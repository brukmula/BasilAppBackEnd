    {
      "3": "Jesus replied, “I tell you the solemn truth, unless a person is born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”"
    },
    {
      "4": "Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter his mother’s womb and be born a second time, can he?”"
    },
    {
      "5": "Jesus answered, “I tell you the solemn truth, unless a person is born of water and spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. "
    },
    {
      "6": "What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit. "
    },
    {
      "7": "Do not be amazed that I said to you, ‘You must all be born from above.’ "
    },
    {
      "8": "The wind blows wherever it will, and you hear the sound it makes, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.” "

      "9": "Nicodemus replied, “How can these things be?” "
    },
    {
      "10": "Jesus answered, “Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you don’t understand these things? "

    },
    {
      "14": "Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, "
    },
    {
      "15": "so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.” "

    },
    {
      "17": "For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world should be saved through him. "
    },
    {
      "18": "The one who believes in him is not condemned. The one who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God. "

      "20": "For everyone who does evil deeds hates the light and does not come to the light, so that their deeds will not be exposed. "
    },
    {
      "21": "But the one who practices the truth comes to the light, so that it may be plainly evident that his deeds have been done in God."

    },
    {
      "25": "Now a dispute came about between some of John’s disciples and a certain Jew concerning ceremonial washing. "
    },
    {
      "26": "So they came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, the one who was with you on the other side of the Jordan River, about whom you testified—see, he is baptizing, and everyone is flocking to him!” "
    },
    {
      "27": "John replied, “No one can receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven. "
    },
    {
      "28": "You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but rather, ‘I have been sent before him.’ "

      "30": "He must become more important while I become less important.” "
    },
    {
      "31": "The one who comes from above is superior to all. The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things. The one who comes from heaven is superior to all. "
    },
    {
      "32": "He testifies about what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. "

### Version Info
Method: GET
#### /api/version-info
This endpoint requires the query parameter `version` to be the abbreviation for that version. For example, the New 
English Translation's abbreviation is `NET`. 
<details>
    <summary>Extra reading</summary>

The reason for this endpoint is that not all versions will have the same 
number of books or chapters in those books. For example, the WEB (World English Bible) contains Psalm 151, which is 
recognized as Deuterocanonical Scripture by the Greek Orthodox and Russian Orthodox Churches. There is, of course, also 
the apocrypha. That's a whole 14 books that some versions also have. They are mostly Catholic Bibles, but also includes 
the 1611 KJV. [This Wikipedia article has a list of notable versions that include it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_apocrypha#:~:text=To%20this%20date%2C%20the%20Apocrypha,and%20Sarah%20in%20the%20Apocrypha%22.)
