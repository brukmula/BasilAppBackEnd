#### Bad requests ([400](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/400))
Bad requests will return the following data:
```js
`invalid passage ${book} ${chapter}`
```

### Version Info
Method: GET
#### /api/version-info
This endpoint requires the query parameter `version` to be the abbreviation for that version. For example, the New 
English Translation's abbreviation is `NET`. 
<details>
    <summary>Extra reading</summary>

The reason for this endpoint is that not all versions will have the same 
number of books or chapters in those books. For example, the WEB (World English Bible) contains Psalm 151, which is 
recognized as Deuterocanonical Scripture by the Greek Orthodox and Russian Orthodox Churches. There is, of course, also 
the apocrypha. That's a whole 14 books that some versions also have. They are mostly Catholic Bibles, but also includes 
the 1611 KJV. [This Wikipedia article has a list of notable versions that include it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_apocrypha#:~:text=To%20this%20date%2C%20the%20Apocrypha,and%20Sarah%20in%20the%20Apocrypha%22.)
